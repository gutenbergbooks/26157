<p class="scene"><strong class="scene">Scene.</strong>&mdash;<i>Drawing-room; door, <strong class="place">L.</strong>, at back looking into hall; chimney
piece <strong class="place">R.</strong> centre; doors on <strong class="place">R.</strong> side in second and third entrances;
door on left second entrance; window left; small sofa and armchair
towards front; escritoire front, <strong class="place">L.</strong> Music to take up
curtain, &ldquo;We Won&rsquo;t Go Home Till Morning,&rdquo; played, piano.
As curtain rises stage is unoccupied and in semi-darkness,
<strong class="name">Selwyn</strong> opens door at back, <strong class="place">L.</strong>, and quietly creeps across, the
collar of his overcoat is up, and his hat is dripping with rain.
He goes <strong class="place">R.</strong> on tiptoe and off third entrance, then returns to fix
a paper on door and exit same way. <strong class="name">Fred Bellamy</strong> then
enters by door at back, <strong class="place">L.</strong>, and executes similar business, holding
his muddy boots in his hand, exit, <strong class="place">L.</strong>, second entrance.</i></p>

<p class="direction"><i>Enter <strong class="name">Dibbs</strong> door right second entrance, yawning and stretching
himself, he carries feather brush in his hand.</i></p>

<p><strong class="speaker">Dibbs.</strong> Ooh! What a shame to have to turn out just when
you begin to appreciate your pillow. (<i>Reading paper on door,
<strong class="place">R.</strong></i>) &ldquo;Call me at tea-time.&rdquo; (<i>Crossing to <strong class="place">L.</strong> and reading paper on
other door.</i>) &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t call me until to-morrow.&rdquo; (<i>Looking at clock
on chimney piece.</i>) Hullo! Only <em>seven</em> o&rsquo;clock! I&rsquo;m up too
soon! I have cheated myself out of a clear hour in bed. Shall
I go back again? No! The governor&rsquo;s left out his cigars and I
know the best brands he keeps three sorts&mdash;these cost about sixpence
each and he smokes &rsquo;em himself&mdash;these are worth perhaps
twopence and are for the use of his friends&mdash;and these he gives to
his father-in-law, warranted real cabbage, five shillings a hundred!
I&rsquo;m not his father-in-law, and I&rsquo;m not his friend, so I&rsquo;ll
have a dip in here. (<i>Taking some from first box.</i>) It&rsquo;s strange
my tastes and the governor&rsquo;s should be so similar&mdash;we both like
the best of everything! (<i>Lighting cigar.</i>) I&rsquo;m not in a bad billet
here, nothing to do and no end of leisure to do it in, especially
when the missus is away; she&rsquo;s gone to her aunt&rsquo;s at Tunbridge
Wells, so master and his friend, Mr. Fred Bellamy, are left to
do as they like. (<i>Sits in easy chair, <strong class="place">L.</strong></i>)</p>

<p><strong class="speaker">Tilly</strong> (<i>entering, <strong class="place">R. 2 E.</strong></i>). Nobody&rsquo;s up yet and so I can go to
the window and kiss my hand to the night policeman before he
goes off his beat. (<i>Going to window.</i>) There he is, leaning
<a name="page4" id="page4"></a><del class="page">4</del>against the lamp post like a &ldquo;Polly bellvurdear&rdquo; in blue. It&rsquo;s
&rsquo;is whiskers as first won my heart! I always had a weakness
for whiskers and I&rsquo;m sure they are the finest in the force! Oh!
what rapture to hear the clergyman say to those whiskers, &ldquo;Wilt
thou have this woman to be thy wedded wife,&rdquo; and to hear those
whiskers reply, &ldquo;I will,&rdquo; and then to walk arm in arm with them
down the church<span class="longdash">&mdash;&mdash;</span>(<i><strong class="name">Dibbs</strong> comes behind her and takes her by the
waist; she screams.</i>) Ah!</p>

<p><strong class="speaker">Dibbs.</strong> Caught you, have I? Making signals to the bobby.
I&rsquo;ll signal him! (<i>Puts finger to his nose at window.</i>)</p>

<p><strong class="speaker">Tilly.</strong> Oh! You impudent young rascal, how dare you insult
a full-grown man; you without so much, as an &rsquo;air to your
upper lip.</p>

<p><strong class="speaker">Dibbs.</strong> I&rsquo;d rather have no mustarchers than a couple of blacking
brushes under my ears! He&rsquo;s gone now! You&rsquo;d better
look on <em>me</em> with an eye of admiration.</p>

<p><strong class="speaker">Tilly.</strong> You! You bare-faced brat! Smoking, too! Won&rsquo;t
you be ill, that&rsquo;s all.</p>

<p><strong class="speaker">Dibbs.</strong> Pooh! I&rsquo;ve been a smoker ever since I was a boy!
(<i><strong class="name">Mr. Selwyn&rsquo;s</strong> voice heard outside calling <strong class="name">Dibbs</strong>.</i>) Hullo! the old
rooster&rsquo;s up early! (<i>Voice, &ldquo;<strong class="name">Dibbs</strong>!&rdquo;</i>)</p>

<p><strong class="speaker">Tilly.</strong> I shall be off, he&rsquo;s sure to be out of temper; masters
and missuses are always grumpy when they first get up. (<i><strong class="name">Dibbs</strong>
kisses <strong class="name">Tilly</strong>, who slaps him. Exit, <strong class="place">L. U. E.</strong></i>)</p>

<p><strong class="speaker">Sel.</strong> (<i>heard off</i>). Dibbs, <em>are</em> you coming?</p>

<p><strong class="speaker">Dibbs.</strong> Yessir! (<i>He endeavors to extinguish lighted cigar by
blowing on it, then opens window and fans the air with feather
brush to get rid of smoke.</i>)</p>

<p class="direction"><i>Enter <strong class="name">Selwyn</strong>, looking very seedy, <strong class="place">R. 3 E.</strong>, in dressing-gown and
carrying a tall hat in his hand which he holds behind him. He
has an &ldquo;up-all-night&rdquo; appearance.</i></p>

<p><strong class="speaker">Sel.</strong> What the deuce are you doing?</p>

<p><strong class="speaker">Dibbs.</strong> Dusting, sir! (<i>He hides cigar in trousers&rsquo; pocket.</i>)</p>

<p><strong class="speaker">Sel.</strong> Do you generally dust <em>the air</em>?</p>

<p><strong class="speaker">Dibbs.</strong> Dust everything, sir. (<i>Aside.</i>) Dash that cigar! It
ain&rsquo;t out! (<i>He pulls it secretly from trousers&rsquo; pocket and again endeavors
to extinguish it.</i>)</p>

<p><strong class="speaker">Sel.</strong> Go and call him; say I want to speak to him at once.</p>

<p><strong class="speaker">Dibbs.</strong> Yessir! (<i>Returning.</i>) As a rule he ain&rsquo;t partial to
being called before eleven, sir!</p>

<p><strong class="speaker">Sel.</strong> Rubbish! I always encourage early rising! <em>When I
am up first myself!</em></p>

the nightmare! <span class="comment" title="Inserted: )">(<i><strong class="name">Dibbs</strong> knocks at door, <strong class="place">L. 2 E.</strong> Sleepy voice

<p class="exit">(<i>Exit <strong class="name">Dibbs</strong>, <strong class="place">L. 2 E.</strong> entrance.</i></p>

<p><strong class="speaker">Sel.</strong> Not a moment is to be lost! My wife will be home by
<a name="page5" id="page5"></a><del class="page">5</del>the first train and if she catches sight of this infernal tile she&rsquo;ll
ask questions. That&rsquo;s the worst of wives, they <em>will</em> be so inquisitive!
Damocles had a sword hanging over his head, I have a
hat! (<i>Putting hat on secretaire.</i>) Now to write to its owner.
(<i>Sitting at table.</i>) &ldquo;Sir, pardon my hastiness last evening&rdquo;<span class="longdash">&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><strong class="speaker">Dibbs</strong> (<i>entering, <strong class="place">L.</strong></i>). Mr. Bellamy&rsquo;s coming, sir.</p>

<p><strong class="speaker">Sel.</strong> (<i>irritably</i>). Coming! Why don&rsquo;t he come! He&rsquo;s always
putting things off!</p>

<p><strong class="speaker">Dibbs.</strong> He&rsquo;s not putting &rsquo;em <em>off</em> this time, sir, he&rsquo;s putting
&rsquo;em <em>on</em>! (<i>Pantomimes getting into trousers.</i>)</p>

<p><strong class="speaker">Sel.</strong> (<i>finishing letter</i>). That will do! A frank but dignified
apology. (<i>Addressing envelope.</i>)&mdash;&ldquo;Tompkins, Esq.&rdquo; Nobody
called this morning inquiring for me, I suppose, Dibbs?</p>

<p><strong class="speaker">Dibbs.</strong> No, sir! (<i>Looking hard at <strong class="name">Selwyn</strong>.</i>) Lord, sir, how
&ldquo;squiffy&rdquo; you do look this morning.</p>

<p><strong class="speaker">Sel.</strong> (<i>sternly</i>). &ldquo;Squiffy,&rdquo; Dibbs?</p>

<p><strong class="speaker">Dibbs.</strong> Yessir&mdash;off color!</p>

as though you&rsquo;d been out on the razzle-dazzle last night, sir.</p>

<p><strong class="speaker">Sel.</strong> Dibbs, I request that you will not indulge in slang out
of your proper sphere&mdash;the kitchen. (<i>Aside.</i>) He&rsquo;s right! I <em>am</em>
&ldquo;squiffy&rdquo;&mdash;in fact, I never was &ldquo;squiffier.&rdquo; Fetch my smoking
cap! (<i>Exit <strong class="name">Dibbs</strong>, <strong class="place">R.</strong></i>) It would be rash of me to assert that I
was not &ldquo;off color&rdquo; and as to being prepared to take my oath
that I did not feel &ldquo;dotty about the <span class="comment" title="Elsewhere, text reads: eye ball">eye-ball</span>&rdquo; I couldn&rsquo;t do it!</p>

<p><strong class="speaker">Dibbs</strong> (<i>re-entering from <strong class="place">R.</strong></i>). Your smoking cap, sir! (<i>He
grins at <strong class="name">Selwyn</strong>.</i>)</p>

<p><strong class="speaker">Dibbs.</strong> Nothing, sir&mdash;except your bed ain&rsquo;t a bit tumbled!</p>

<p><strong class="speaker">Sel.</strong> What of that? I suffered from the toothache and had
to walk about all night!</p>

<p><strong class="speaker">Dibbs.</strong> Then the roof must want mending, for the rain comes
into your room, sir&mdash;your clothes are all sopping wet! Oh, sir,
<em>if</em> I didn&rsquo;t know you, sir, I should say you had taken advantage
of the missus&rsquo; absence to go out on the kick!</p>

<p><strong class="speaker">Sel.</strong> Dibbs, would you dare!<span class="longdash">&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><strong class="speaker">Dibbs.</strong> I say, sir <em>if</em> I did not know you!</p>

showing coin.</i>) See nothing, say nothing!</p>

<p><strong class="speaker">Dibbs.</strong> Oh, sir! Don&rsquo;t force it on me! (<i>Takes money and
puts it in his pocket.</i>) It shall be a secret between <em>man and man</em>.
Mum&rsquo;s the word to the missus!</p>

<p><strong class="speaker">Sel.</strong> (<i>aside</i>). I wish I dared kick him!</p>

<p><strong class="speaker">Sel.</strong> At last, my dear Fred, at last! I want you to do me a
favor!</p>

<p><strong class="speaker">Fred</strong> (<i>aside</i>). I suppose so! (<i>Aloud.</i>) I certainly do not
<a name="page6" id="page6"></a><del class="page">6</del>consider it doing <em>me</em> a favor when I am awoke at unearthly
hours.</p>

<p><strong class="speaker">Sel.</strong> First let me explain&mdash;(<i>noticing <strong class="name">Dibbs</strong> is listening.</i>) Thank
you, Dibbs, I shall not want you any more!</p>

<p><strong class="speaker">Dibbs</strong> (<i>aside</i>). As usual! Always turned out when the interest
begins! Never mind, I&rsquo;ve got a very good ear and the
door&rsquo;s got a very good key-hole; and by putting this (<i>touching
ear</i>) and that (<i>pointing to key-hole</i>) together, I may hear of something
to my advantage as the advertisements say.</p>

<p><strong class="speaker">Sel.</strong> I was going to say &ldquo;on,&rdquo; but it&rsquo;s a detail. I remember
that about the Marble Arch I saw a Vision of Loveliness approach
me. The vision evidently desired me to do her a
favor<span class="longdash">&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><strong class="speaker">Fred.</strong> Had you ever saved <em>her</em> life then?</p>

<p><strong class="speaker">Sel.</strong> No! The timid creature only wanted to be directed to
Ludgate Hill; while endeavoring to explain a short cut we
walked as far as <span class="note" title="Text reads: Piccadily">Piccadilly</span> together. I believe I offered to escort
her.</p>

<p><strong class="speaker">Fred.</strong> And she accepted?</p>

<p><strong class="speaker">Sel.</strong> After <em>much</em> hesitation! We chatted and got quite good
friends and at last passed by the &ldquo;Geranium,&rdquo; a highly respectable
establishment, where, you know they admit ladies as well
as gentlemen.</p>

<p><strong class="speaker">Fred.</strong> A cock and hen club!</p>

<p><strong class="speaker">Sel.</strong> Yes&mdash;but that&rsquo;s a detail&mdash;suddenly the thought struck
me to ask her if she had supped and if she would accept&mdash;(<i>Gesture.</i>)
She replied, no!</p>

battle of&mdash;no, that was her brother&mdash;at any rate, the time passed
most pleasantly, when all of a sudden she asked me my name; I

<h3>PEREGRINATIONS OF POLLY</h3>

<p class="summary">Comedietta in One Act. Three Females</p>

<p class="author">By Helen P. Kane</p>

<p>One plain Interior scene. Polly and Margaret, bachelor maids,
being invited to attend a musicale, determine to exchange escorts. The
result may not have been such as was intended, but certainly was one
to have been expected. The dialogue throughout is brilliant and
snappy, the action quick, thus ensuring a success for this bright
sketch. Plays forty-five minutes.</p>

<p class="price">PRICE 25 CENTS</p>

<h3>THE RAINBOW KIMONA</h3>

<p class="summary">Comedy in Two Acts. Nine Females</p>

<p class="author">By Eleanor Maud Crane</p>

<p>One interior scene. The Rainbow Kimona is a club composed of
seven of the Senior Class, each member wearing a kimona representing
one of the colors of the rainbow. In a small apartment an entertainment
is arranged in which each girl assumes a leading character in
one of Shakespeare&rsquo;s plays, burlesqued in outrageously comical style.
The whole thing is a medley of the most amusing kind. Plays one
and a half hours.</p>

<p class="price">PRICE 35 CENTS</p>

<h3>OUTWITTED</h3>

<p class="summary">Society Sketch in One Act. Three Females</p>

<p>One interior scene. Two of the girls twit each other about the
attentions of a handsome young army officer at a ball the night
previous, each covertly aiming to outwit the other. It transpires later
that the officer has had a little tiff with another girl to whom he was
engaged, and his attentions were merely side-play. For cutting but
polite sarcasm this sketch is rarely equalled. Plays twenty minutes.</p>

<p class="price">PRICE 15 CENTS</p>

<h3>THE FUTURE LADY HOLLAND</h3>

<p class="summary">Comedy in Three Acts. Four Females</p>

<p class="author">By Helen P. Kane</p>

<p>One interior scene. The dowager Lady Holland has arranged that
her niece, Diana, should marry Lester, the present Lord Holland, son
of the dowager. To that end she directs another niece, Yvonne, to
devote herself to Stacy Brent, thus throwing Diana and Lester together.
